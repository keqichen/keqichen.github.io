Hi, I’m Keqi — a software engineer in London.

<!-- ![Astro Paper](public/about-profile.jpg) -->

Early on I was drawn to the humanities and devoted myself to medieval philosophy, exploring semantics, metaphysics, and ethics in the 11th century (My PhD thesis is open access [here](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/1d9cdce9-5cef-4cea-a27f-25365fb35e3f)). Over time I came to know the beauty and the limits of pure thought. Philosophy always nourishes my life and shapes how I think, but I wanted the answers to touch real people. 

So I taught myself Python and JavaScript, and quickly recognised a familiar pattern: start from first principles, frame the problem, reason rigorously, then build the system. The difference is that in code, the idea doesn’t just stay on the page; it runs in the world.

Today I work at a FinTech scale-up in London, building a CRM platform that simplifies the mortgage process. I specialise in React/TypeScript, GraphQL and Apollo, with a particular passion for performance optimisation and system design. I care deeply about delivering high-quality, scalable solutions that transform complex data relationships into intuitive user journeys.

Outside work, I experiment with UE5 for game development and React Native for mobile apps. When I'm not coding, you'll find me painting, bouldering or gaming.

I love working with people who take their commitments seriously and bring passion to what they build. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or chat — and if you notice anything I could improve in a post, please tell me :)
