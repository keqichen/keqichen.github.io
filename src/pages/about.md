Hi, I’m Keqi — a software engineer in London.

Early on I was drawn to the humanities and devoted myself to medieval philosophy, exploring semantics, metaphysics, and ethics in the 11th century (My PhD thesis is open access [here](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/1d9cdce9-5cef-4cea-a27f-25365fb35e3f)). Over time I came to know the beauty and the limits of pure thought. Philosophy always nourishes my life and shapes how I think, but I wanted the answers to touch real people. 

So I taught myself Python and JavaScript, and quickly recognized a familiar pattern: start from first principles, frame the problem, reason rigorously, then build the system. The difference is that in code, the idea doesn’t just stay on the page; it runs in the world.

Today I work at a FinTech scale-up in London, building a CRM platform that simplifies the mortgage process. I enjoy transforming complex data relationships into intuitive user journeys with React/TypeScript and GraphQL, making sure architecture remains clean while user journeys stay intuitive.

Outside work, I experiment with UE5 for game development and React Native for mobile apps. When I'm not coding, you'll find me painting, bouldering or gaming.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or chat.
