Hi, I’m Keqi — a philosopher-turned front-end engineer. 

In the early stage of my life, I devoted myself to medieval philosophy in a quiet English town, exploring semantics, metaphysics, and ethics (My PhD thesis is open access [here](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/1d9cdce9-5cef-4cea-a27f-25365fb35e3f)). I came to know the beauty and the limits of pure thought. Unlike Plato’s cave, where one ascends from shadows to ideals, I took the reverse journey — leaving the realm of ideals to return to the weight of the tangible world.

That turn brought me to tech. Philosophy still shapes how I think, but I wanted its answers to touch real people. So I taught myself Python and JavaScript, and quickly recognized a familiar pattern: start from first principles, structure the problem, reason carefully, then build systems. The difference is that in code, the idea doesn’t just stay on the page; it runs in the world.

Today I work at Acre in London, building a CRM platform that simplifies the mortgage process. I thrive on transforming complex data relationships into intuitive user journeys with React/TypeScript and GraphQL, making sure architecture remains clean while user journeys stay intuitive.

Outside work, I experiment with UE5 for game development and React Native for mobile apps. When I'm not coding, you'll find me painting, bouldering or gaming.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or chat.
